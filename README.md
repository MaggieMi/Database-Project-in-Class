Database-Project-in-Class
=========================

build a database from scratch and a website connect the database by using php, mysql, html and css
so, I built the whole system from scratch by myself, since my teammate is lazy. The topic of the database and website 
is mobile application rating storage. So, the tables in database contains information about users and their ratings for
each application and also the descriptions. 
The user can modify their rating and their personal information in the website by typing what they want.
